### Project Overview

### Data Source

The data for this analysis is gotten from a Data Learning Community I joined in April 2024 called The Data Initiative (TDI). It contains detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Data Tools

- Excel - This was used for data cleaning, data analysis and data visualization.
- PowerPoint - This was used for the live presentation of this project.

### Data Cleaning

To achieve a clean and presentable data, I took the following steps:
1.	Checking for blanks.
2.	I also checked for spelling errors and discovered there were none.
3.	I checked for duplicates, there were no duplicates.
4.	Then I filtered the data.
5.	The customer type column was 0 and 1, indicating Members and Non-members. So I used the IF function “=IF (D2=0, “Member”, “Non-member”). This function changed my customer type column to Members and Non-members.
6.	Next, I changed the gender column, using IF function, changing M and F to Male and Female respectively.
7.	The unit price, total, COGS, gross income columns were changed to accounting format to include the dollar symbol.
8.	I formatted the time column to Time to include AM and PM.
9.	I included percentage symbol in the gross margin percentage column.

### Project Objectives

For this project, I drafted out the following objectives:
- Determine the total sales in the supermarket. This includes the sales of each product line, customer type, gender and branch.
- To determine the profit generated by each product line, customer type, gender and branch.
- Identify most used payment method
- Most popular product line and branch
- Ascertain average customer satisfaction/ Ratings

### Analysis and Insights

#### Sales Performance by Branch and City
•	Branch C outperforms other branches with the highest total sales at $110,569.

#### Customer Type
•	Members contribute to 50.85% of total sales, Non-Members contribute 49.15%, but non-members has the highest average ratings compared to Members.
•	Female customers slightly outnumber male customers, with a notable difference in purchasing behavior.

#### Product Line Performance
•	Food and beverages are the top-selling product line, followed by Sports and travel.
•	Fashion accessories products have the highest average unit price.

#### Sales by Month
•	Peak sales occurred in January at $116,292.
•	The lowest sales was in February at $97,219

#### Payment Methods
•	E-wallet and cash is the most preferred payment method, followed by Credit Card.

#### Cost and Profit Analysis
•	Gross Margin of 4.76% is relatively low. Costs are high and pricing power is limited.

#### Customer Ratings
•	The average customer rating is 6.97, indicating a decent satisfaction rate considering that there were 1000 orders in total.
•	Food and beverages receive the highest ratings which is 7.11 at average, while Home and lifestyle have the lowest, 6.84.

### Key Findings

•	Branch C located at Naypyitaw has the highest sales. 
•	Gross Margin of 4.76% is relatively low, indicating that costs are high.
•	Food and beverages is the most popular product line among all customers.
•	Members are highly valuable customers, however non-members has the highest average rating.
•	More customers use E-wallet and cash as a means of payment in the supermarket.

### Recommendations

In light of the major problem of the business to increase the gross margin percentage:
•	To improve profitability, it is advisable to reduce the cost of goods sold, this can be done by negotiating cheaper prices with suppliers for bulk purchases.
•	Increasing the quantities of each product line can also increase profits
•	Increase marketing efforts in the top-performing branch which is Branch C.
•	Focus on converting normal customers to members through loyalty programs.

### Limitations

I had to figure out how best to tell a story through my analysis, I also had to think of what problems the company was facing by looking at the sales dataset alone. I had to draft out problem statements and objectives as instructed by TDI.
